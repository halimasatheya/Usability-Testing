							  <h2>What is Concurrent Think Aloud?</h2>
							  <p>User expresses thier thoughts out aloud whilst conducting tasks</p> 
							</div>
						
							
					
							<p> A method used to gather users opinions whilst conducting tasks users are asked to talk out aloud and say what they are thinking and what they are doing and how they feel as they carry out the task.  This method gains qualitative data and allows observers to see how users complete tasks with their products/services. <br>

However I personally believe that a think aloud method may be useful and beneficial but is it really true does the user really say what they think they may modify thier thoughts or is it a matter of the user inventing thoughts they did not have just because the observer is present and as they are being watched. Alternatively the best ways in my opinion to get true answers are to conduct a Retrospective think aloud (RTA) instead of a concurrent think aloud (CTA).<br> 

<br>Retrospective think aloud is a method in which users carry out tasks and the task is recorded and the user sits with the facilitator and goes through their experiences once the tasks have been completed. This is less biased compared Concurrent Think Aloud.
