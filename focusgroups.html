						      <p>A Focus Group is a discussion that takes place with a group of users. The discussion will either be on a new proposed product or a existing product/service. The main aim of a focus group is to gather the intended users personal views, attitudes and opinions on a subject. A focus group is conducted by a moderator who asks questions or talks about a specific topic in which a small group of individuals usually around 6-8 will have a discussion. A focus group is conducted in a well known comfortable setting.

						        <p>Allows you to gain what the user exactly wants, by making sure the users input is implemented into the development stage means more chances of meeting the users needs and providing a more useable product. As there's no point creating an application or software in which the users needs are not even considered. Focus groups give you useful data and allow you to gain users ideas and reactions to a product. It is inexpensive so any business should be able to implement it within their product life cycle.

                            I conducted a focus group for a cake delivery app, a total of 6 particpants were used for the focus group.
                                3 females and 3 males.

<b>Facilitator:</b> If you could create an app for a caking business what kind of app would you design?
<br><b>Neelam:</b> An app where you can order cakes
<br><b>Nasieba:</b> Where like you can get recipes

<br><b>Facilitator:</b> If it was a cake delivery app, what kind of things should it include?
<br><b>Nasieba:</b> What type of cakes they have, prices.
<br><b>Neelam:</b> Delivery details, comparison of different cakes
<br><b>Leigh:</b> Maybe design your own cake
<br><b>Facilitator:</b> What kind of cakes would you like within the app?
<br><b>Nasieba:</b> Ready made cakes
<br><b>Neelam:</b>  Or also you know like some websites have different cakes for different occasions you could have that, ready made cakes for different occasions that kind of thing

<b>Facilitator:</b> What are your ideas on a potential cake delivery app?
<br><b>Mo:</b> It should include like maps,
<br><b>Oliver:</b> Build your cake and get it delivered
<br><b>Oliver:</b> How far you deliver that kind of stuff

<br><b>Mo:</b>  You can have like different categories like you can pick the base of the cake, then the toppings then you can have
<br><b>Oliver:</b> Flavour, size
<br><b>Mo:</b> Personalised message on it
<br><b>Mustakim:</b> Colours, decorations, sprinkles and whatever
<br><b>Oliver:</b> Have drop down boxes, that kind of thing select your options,
<br><b>Mustakim:</b> Have you used Nike id?
<br><b>Facilitator:</b> No I have heard of it but not used it
<br><b>Oliver:</b> You select each area
<br><b>Mustakim:</b> Yeah like that, it has the product and you just change the colours, and other details and things.<br>

                                
                            <br><div class="row3">

                         <p>From the first focus group they wanted an interface that included drop down boxes and a similar idea to Nike id                                 where you can preview your product so in this case a cake preview. 
                                The second focus group wished to have a create your own cake option as well as                                                                 being able to see where the cake business delivers to, 
                                maps was also another element mentioned by the boys group. 

                                By conducting this focus group I myself didn't think of the ideas 
                                that the users came up with such as cake
                                customisation on which you could make your own cake and be
                                able to see the changes, as well as certain features as mentioned above. </p>
