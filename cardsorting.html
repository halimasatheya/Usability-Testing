						<h4> What is Card Sorting?</h4>
						</div>
						
						
						<p class="text-center">
						<br>Card sorting is a usability tool that is used in user experience design,
						usually used when designing information structure, navigation website, 
						<br>menu structure. 
						It is used when a variety of content needs to be sorted i.e.
						structured into correct categories. 
						<br>The card sort allows us to gain different users perception on how they
						personally would navigate through the site. 
						<br>This can be crucial information for developers who want to know how intended
						users would personally like the website or menu structure to be.</p>

						  <h4>Why you should use card sorting?</h4>
						  <div class="row">
						    <div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:silver;">
						      <p>The main aim of card sorting is to know whether the current information structure or proposed navigation you have planned for a website or app is correct and whether its working for your users. Because if your customers are having a bad user experience due to navigation not being structured properly your loosing customers and gaining a bad reputation at the same time.</p>
						      <p>The card sorting tool allows you to make sure that the user is able to find the product or the goal for which they came on to your website to achieve.</p>

The card sorting tool allows you to make sure that the user is able to find the product or the goal for which they came on to your website to achieve. 
						
						By never conducting a card sort you'll never know what your users think about the information structure and categories for a website navigation.

						<p>	An open card sort is when the intended user is given all index cards and the user is asked to arrange the cards in a suitable way in which they think relates.

						<p>A closed card sort is when the intended user is given both index cards and categories and is asked to sort the index cards into the categories, which they think best fit. Closed card sorting allows you to see whether the categories you already have in place are correct also which index cards the user thinks best fits in each category. </p>
